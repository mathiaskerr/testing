### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   # should be double == in line 21. colon after else line 23

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
#dif should be def and there should be a comma between card1 and card2. the function body should be indented. first return says card but should say card1  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total 
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
  #total should = 0 in line 36. return is indented wrong, it should be after the for loop not in it. the whole function is indented wrong making it sit outside the class
```
